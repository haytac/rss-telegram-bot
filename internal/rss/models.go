// This file might have been intended for additional RSS-specific models if FetchResult wasn't enough.
// If FetchResult (in fetcher.go) is sufficient, this file might not be strictly needed
// or could be a placeholder for future expansion.
// For now, to satisfy the compiler, make sure it has at least the package declaration.

// If you intended specific models here, add them.
